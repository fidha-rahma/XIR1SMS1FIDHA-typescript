/**
 * An online learning platform stores course completion information.
 * The academy director wants a dashboard containing:
 * Completion Statistics:
 * - Total enrollments
 * - Completed enrollments
 * - Incomplete enrollments
 * - Completion percentage
 * 
 * Academic Statistics:
 * - Highest score
 * - Lowest score
 * - Average score
 * - Students with passing scores (≥ 75)
 * 
 * Course Statistics:
 * - Number of students enrolled in each course
 * - Average score for each course
 * 
 * Learning Statistics:
 * - Total learning hours
 * - Average learning duration
 * 
 * Student Tasks:
 * You must design your own program architecture.
 * Requirements
 * Your solution must contain:
 * - At least 10 non-void functions
 * - At least 2 void functions
 * - No duplicated calculations
 * - Each function must have one responsibility
 * - Every printed value must come from another function
 * - Use meaningful function names and parameters
 * Reuse existing functions whenever possible
